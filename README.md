# NBA Games Analysis

## Project Overview
This project conducts an extensive analysis of NBA games, leveraging data from [Nathan Lauga's NBA dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games). The study utilizes machine learning to predict game outcomes and analyze player performances across multiple seasons. This analysis is organized into three Jupyter notebooks and a comprehensive report, each detailing different facets of the NBA data.

## Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** To uncover key trends and patterns in player performances and game outcomes.
- **Classification Models:** To predict the likelihood of a home team's victory.
- **Regression Models:** To forecast the home team's total score based on various game statistics.
- **Report Generation:** To provide insights and a detailed methodology of the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Features
- Detailed statistical analysis of game and player data.
- Predictive modeling for game outcomes and scoring.
- Visual representations of data trends and predictions.
